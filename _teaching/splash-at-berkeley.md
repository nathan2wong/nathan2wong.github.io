What is a website? How do you make your own website? How can you get other people on
the internet to view your website? We will explore these questions and students will have an
opportunity to create their own website in this class. 

Course Objectives
======

1. Understand the basic principles of the internet – both its historical evolution and its
modern applications. We will focus on the protocols and languages used to make
surfing the internet a seamless process.
2. Understand what a website is and what interactions are involved when your
computer visits a website. We will explore answers to these questions – including
learning the difference between public and privatized websites.
3. Learn how to create your own website – specifically how to use basic functions of
HTML and CSS. We will go over exercises which are designed to serve as a jumping
board for you to learn more about web development in your own time. Resources to
learn web development will be provided.
