Hi! I'm Nathan, a software engineer in the SF Bay Area. I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and biological applications. Specifically, I leverage advances in biocomputation and machine learning to further our understanding of aging, neurodegeneration, and age-associated diseases. Broadly, my research focuses on machine learning, bioinformatics, aging and stem cell research, computational imaging, and scientific software development.
