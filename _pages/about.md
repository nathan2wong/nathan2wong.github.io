<!--Undergraduate Researcher at the [Conboy Lab](https://conboylab.berkeley.edu)

Hi! I'm Nathan, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and biological applications. Specifically, I leverage advances in biocomputation and machine learning to further our understanding of aging, neurodegeneration, and age-associated diseases. Broadly, my research focuses on machine learning, bioinformatics, aging and stem cell research, computational imaging, and scientific software development.
